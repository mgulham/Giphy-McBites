Feelin' Like a Villain! 

A functioning click activated API Call.

This webpage will call the top 10 results of a selected query, which in this case is different villains.

10 villains are pre-chosen and put into an array. This array is pushed into the form of 10 buttons displayed on the top of the webpage. When a villain button is clicked, an API call is made performing a query which responds with the top 10 results (gifts and their rating) of the selected villain query. These responses are then pushed onto the webpage.

Additionally, each time a GIF is clicked, they will becoQme still. If the GIF is animated, it will become still after a click. 

The purpose of this exercise is establishing familiarity with API requests and manipulating responses.
